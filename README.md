# Predictive Maintenance of Machine

## Step 1: Project Overview
Predictive Maintenance uses Machine Learning to predict machine failures before they occur using sensor data.  
This helps industries reduce unexpected breakdowns and maintenance costs.

---

## Step 2: Objective
- Predict machine failure in advance
- Reduce machine downtime
- Improve maintenance efficiency

---

## Step 3: Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## Step 4: Dataset Description
The dataset contains machine sensor data such as:
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Vibration
- Operational conditions
- Failure status

---

## Step 5: Workflow
1. Data collection  
2. Data preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis  
4. Feature selection  
5. Model training  
6. Model evaluation  
7. Failure prediction  

---

## Step 6: Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

---

## Step 7: Results
- Machine failure prediction achieved good accuracy
- Random Forest performed better than other models
- Helps in proactive maintenance planning
